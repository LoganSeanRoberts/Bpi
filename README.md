## Logan's B to pi PhD work

This WIP repository will, hopefully, contain all the important python scripts I've used for this project.  This will serve 2 purposes:
1) To provide open source access to all the work I've done over the past 3+ years.
2) To make it easy for whoever takes over my work to understand what I've done, and how to use my scripts as is with minimal friction.

We will see how that all turns out over the next couple months
